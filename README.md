# Description
Earth's last hope is in your hands, take control of the lone spaceship and protect Earth from alien swarms. Your goal will be quite challenging as you will have to save the Universe from its evil enemies. In this space shooting game, you will be facing an increasingly large number of enemies in hazardous environments. As the game progresses, you will earn the right to upgrade your spacecraft to unleash its full lethal capacity. <br />
<br />
In this project you have to develop a mini version of the alien shooter on the console using Assembly language. You have to develop three different levels of game. The description of each level has been given in the Description.pdf. <br />
<br />
Other than these three levels you have to also make game start and end screens. Firstof all start screen will show up the name of the game, followed by the screen that asks for username. At the end, the screen should show the score, level and Win or Lose. <br />
